READ ME

I am using this project as a way of learning about GIT, Ruby, Rails, Sinatra, and so on.

There is really very little to see here right now but as I mess about the code base is sure to expand.

So far the code is a simple Sinatra app called shelloworld.rb

% ruby shelloworld.rb

then go to http://localhost:4567

It will say 'Sinatra, via HAML, says "Hello World".'

go to http://localhost:4567/hello/<your name>

It will say 'Sinatra, via HAML, says "Hello <your name>".'

This is unit tested via

% ruby tests/shelloworld_test.rb

Cheers

Dave
